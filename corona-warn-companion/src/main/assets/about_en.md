# Features
This app helps you to better understand warnings of the official Corona-Warn-App.

**ATTENTION:** To access the same recorded encounters as the official Corona-Warn-App, this app requires ROOT permissions. Without root permissions, the app can only be used together with the RaMBLE app, or with the CCTG app / microG.

### What the app does:
1. The app reads the Rolling Proximity IDs recorded by your device from the Exposure Notifications database (this is only possible with root permissions, which is why official Exposure Notifications apps, such as Corona-Warn-App, cannot display these details).

   Alternatively, the app can also read a database exported from RaMBLE (does not need root permissions).

2. The app downloads the Diagnosis Keys from the official German Corona-Warn-Server and other countries' servers, as selected by you. For Germany, it downloads the keys published daily for the last few days, and the keys published every hour for today. Therefore, different information than in the official app might be displayed.

3. The app compares both in order to find matches (risk encounters).

   ![-Example Matches-](file:///android_asset/matches_en.png)

If risk encounters are found, it shows the details:
At which times and with which radio attenuation (roughly corresponds to the distance) did the encounters take place, and what level of transmission risk did the encounters have. For encounters that were recorded by RaMBLE, it can also display the location.

Note that 1 means a low and 8 means a high transmission risk.

### What the app does not do:
- The app does not process any personal data.
- The app only accesses the internet for the purpose 2 (see above), i.e. it only downloads data from the official warning servers and does not send any data to other servers (unless you ask it to show the location of an encounter, in which case it will contact OpenStreetMap servers).
- The app does not show any advertising.

# Open Source
